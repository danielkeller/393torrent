\section{Business Requirements}
\subsection{Background, Business Opportunity, and Customer Needs}
Many heavyweight BitTorrent clients currently exist that are littered with ads, masking the primary functionality for the user.

\subsection{Business Objectives and Success Criteria}
%this creates a labeled list
\begin{description}
\item[BO-1] Follow BitTorrent specification
\item[BO-2] Create usable alternative to mainstream BitTorrent clients
\item[BO-3] Perform the most important functions of BitTorrent clients
\item[BO-4] Needs to be fast:
Load in \textless500ms,
Respond to user in \textless100ms.
\item[SC-1] Group members can use the program for their day-to-day BitTorrent tasks
\end{description}

\subsection{Business Risks}
\begin{description}
\item[RI-1] Software bugs could potentially compromise security
\item[RI-2] Software could crash with too many simultaneous downloads
\end{description}


\section{Vision of the Solution}
\subsection{Vision Statement}
To create a lightweight BitTorrent application free of advertisements, providing ease of use and ultimate productivity for the user.  Users will be able to upload and download files, create torrents, and configure the client without the inconvenience of advertisements.
\subsection{Major Features}
%numbered list
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ability to download a file
\item Ability to display progress to user
\item Ability to upload a file
\item Ability to pause/resume
\item Ability to create torrents
\item Ability to download multiple torrents at once
\item Optimal download speed with use of appropriate algorithms
\item Official extensions - fast peer, dht, encryption
\item Support for magnet links
\item Configurable
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{description}
\item[AS-1] Specification documentation is correct
\item[DE-1] Client must be compatible with Windows, Linux, iOS;
System will be developed as a command line program; time permitting, a GUI may be added.
\end{description}

\section{Business Context}
\subsection{Stakeholder Profiles}
\tabcolsep=0.11cm
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| X | X | X | X | X |}
\hline
\textbf{Stakeholder} & \textbf{Major Value} & \textbf{Attitudes} & \textbf{Major Interests} & \textbf{Constraints} \\
\hline
\hline
Developers & Creation of the BitTorrent client & Commitment through all versions & Quality, performance, maintainability, scalability & Most members learning Haskell for the first time \\
\hline
Seeders & Give downloaders opportunity to download files; more seeders allow faster download times & Allow others to download file from them & Providing service to downloaders &  \\ 
\hline
Downloaders & People who download files from seeders & May or may not become seeders or leechers & Getting a specific file for their use & Number of seeders \\
\hline
Leechers& None, they do not contribute anything & Benefit from downloaded files, but do not offer to seed & Acquiring information and files & \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Project Priorities}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| X | X | X | X |}
\hline
\textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Constraint} & \textbf{Degree of Freedom} \\
\hline
\hline
Schedule & & Limited to one semester of work; must hit project milestones for given dates & A new release must be delivered every week \\
\hline
Features & Getting features right means users are satisfied & In each release, features for that release must be fully operational & Features for specified release must be included and work \\
\hline
Quality  & & All unit tests must pass; all security tests must pass; compliance with software specification must be enforced & Test-driven development will be utilized to ensure quality\\
\hline
Scalability & Code will be able to add features and extensions as needed & For the client to be lightweight, scope must be limited & \\
\hline
Maintainability & Code will follow good programming practices & Maintainable code depends largely on the discipline of the developers &  \\
\hline
Performance & Code will maintain the performance specifications as stated in the business objectives &  & \\
\hline
Scalability & & Can download payloads of any size without using over 50MB of RAM & \\
\hline
Members  & 4 developers who will all write code and test & Many new to functional programming & \\
