\section{Business Requirements}
\subsection{Background, Business Opportunity, and Customer Needs}
Many heavyweight BitTorrent clients currently exist that are littered with ads, masking the primary functionality for the user.

\subsection{Business Objectives and Success Criteria}
%this creates a labeled list
\begin{description}
\item[BO-1] Follow BitTorrent specification
\item[BO-2] Create usable alternative to mainstream BitTorrent clients
\item[BO-3] Perform the most important functions of BitTorrent clients
\item[BO-4] Needs to be fast 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Load in \textless500ms
  \item Respond to user in \textless100ms
\end{enumerate}
\\
\item[SC-1] Group members can use the program for their day-to-day BitTorrent tasks
\end{description}

\subsection{Business Risks}
\begin{description}
\item[RI-1] Software bugs could potentially compromise security
\item[RI-2] Software could crash with too many simultaneous downloads
\end{description}


\section{Vision of the Solution}
\subsection{Vision Statement}
To create a lightweight BitTorrent application free of advertisements, providing ease of use and ultimate productivity for the user.  Users will be able to upload and download files, create torrents, and configure the client without the inconvenience of advertisements.
\subsection{Major Features}
%numbered list
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ability to download a file
\item Ability to upload a file
\item Ability to submit user feedback
\item Ability to pause/resume
\item Ability to create torrents
\item Ability to download multiple torrents at once
\item Optimal download speed with use of appropriate algorithms
\item Official extensions - fast peer, dht, encryption
\item Magnet links
\item Configurable
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{description}
\item[AS-1] Specification documentation is correct
\item[DE-1] Client must be compatible with Windows, Linux, iOS
System will be developed as a command line program; time permitting, a GUI may be added.
\end{description}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
\subsection{Scope of Initial and Subsequent Releases}
%this is how you do a table. the ells are left alignment and the bars are vertical lines

Developers
  & Creation of the BitTorrent client 
  & Commitment through all versions 
  & Quality, performance, maintainability, scalability 
  & Most members learning Haskell for the first time \\
Seeders     
  & Give downloaders opportunity to download files; more seeders allow faster download times 
  & Allow others to download file from them 
  & Providing service to downloaders 
  &  \\ 
Downloaders 
  & People who download files from seeders 
  & May or may not become seeders or leechers
  & Getting a specific file for their use
  & \\
Leechers
  & None, they do not contribute anything 
  & Benefit from downloaded files, but do not offer to seed 
  & Acquiring information and files 
  & \\
